			<h2>Subtheme: Visualizing Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How has the “executive belt” surrounding Boston changed? Do
				these areas still have extensive single-family zoning? </li>
				<li>Are there certain municipalities that have higher fractions
				of non-white residents? Do municipalities with higher fractions
				have less single-family zoning? Are there observable differences
				in income, household size, and number of children?</li>
				<li>Which municipalities that sought “no growth” achieved it?
				How much did they grow/evolve since the 1970's?</li>
				<li>How are rail network access and municipal housing
				composition related? </li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			The dataset provided by The Warren Group consists of information on
			residential zoning, demographics, and household income and
			composition for municipalities served by the Boston Metropolitian
			Area Planning Council. Prior to engaging with this data, I read
			<em>Exclusionary by Design</em> by Amy Dain. This report details the
			history of exclusionary zoning practices in Greater Boston,
			including fiscal, class, and racist zoning, since the 1920's. My
			analysis will focus on similar themes.
			
			Before approaching my overall analysis questions, I began with a
			brief review of data quality. The first thing I discovered was that
			some municipalities are duplicated in the dataset. For such
			municipalities, the data on areas zoned for single-family housing is
			recorded separately and notated by a <em>only_single_housing</em>
			flag.

				After filtering out the separate single-family data, I began by looking at the percentage of residential land zoned for single-family housing in each municipality, as shown in the chart above.
