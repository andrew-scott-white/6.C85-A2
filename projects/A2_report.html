			<h2>Subtheme: Visualizing Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>How has the “executive belt” surrounding Boston changed?
				Do these areas still have extensive single-family zoning?</b> —
				Recently, there have been strong efforts to change <a
				href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2023/11/15/brookline-passes-rezoning-plan-more-multifamily-housing/">zoning
				laws</a> and prioritize <a
				href="https://www.bostonplans.org/planning/planning-initiatives/fostering-transit">transit-oriented
				development</a>. Have we started to see any changes in
				municipalities previously aligned with the "executive belt"?
				Have any such municipalities drastically overhauled their
				restrictive zoning?
				</li>
				<li><b>Are there certain municipalities that have higher
				fractions of non-white residents? Do municipalities with higher
				fractions have less single-family zoning? Are there observable
				differences between municipalities in terms of income or number
				of children?</b> — Amy Dain extensively talks about
				municipalities historically using zoning laws to exclude based on class and
				race. I am curious to what extent those laws and impacts persist today.</li> 
				<li><b>How are rail network access and municipal housing
				composition related?</b> — Public transit and dense housing are
				often considered as <a href="https://www.ncrc.org/planetizen-the-symbiotic-relationship-of-housing-and-transit/">symbiotic</a>, where denser housing
				necessitates improved transit and improved transit encourages
				denser housing. Accordingly, I wonder how the stated growth
				policies and municipal zoning restrictions correspond to MBTA
				rail service, particularly with regards to dates of development,
				routes available, and frequency of service.</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			The dataset provided by The Warren Group consists of information on
			residential zoning, demographics, and household income and
			composition for municipalities served by the Boston Metropolitian
			Area Planning Council. Prior to engaging with this data, I read
			<em>Exclusionary by Design</em> by Amy Dain. This report details the
			history of exclusionary zoning practices in Greater Boston,
			including fiscal, class, and racist zoning, since the 1920's. My
			analysis will focus on similar themes.
			
			Before approaching my overall analysis questions, I began with a
			brief review of data quality. The first thing I discovered was that
			some municipalities are duplicated in the dataset. For such
			municipalities, the data on areas zoned for single-family housing is
			recorded separately and notated by a <label
			for="only_single_housing"></label>
			flag. These single-family-only datasets were filtered out using this
			flag; the analysis to follow focuses on whole municipalities. When
			considering flat population numbers, large municipalities such as
			Boston and Cambridge skew the results. Therefore, rather than filter
			out certain municipalities, I will use population fractions or
			percentages extensively throughout this analysis.

				<figcaption>
				The percentage of residential area zoned for single-family
				housing is shown on the vertical axis for each Boston
				Metropolitian Area municipality listed on the horizontal axis.
				The dashed line indicates 50% single-family zoning, highlighting
				the 48 municipalities that zone the majority of their
				residential land for single-family housing. Of note, there are
				many municipalities that have zero single-family zoning as well.
				I was surprised to see some "executive belt" municipalities
				among them, which motivated Figure 3. It is also surprising that
				some municipalities are zoned for 100% single-family housing. Is
				there really not one apartment building in these regions?

				<figcaption>
				The percentage of residential area zoned for single-family
				housing is shown in three colors indicating low (pink),
				moderate (orange), and high (red) percentages. Assessing this
				data in a map highlights spatial effects including the
				"Executive Belt", dubbed by the Boston Globe in 1960, where
				municipalities extensively zoned for single-family estates.
				These municipalities used exclusionary zoning techniques to
				encourage and maintain affluent and predominantly white
				communities.

				<img src="../images/SF-percentage-belt_map.png" alt="map of single-family housing percentage of different municipalities described as part of the executive belt." width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					To address my first analysis question, the percentage of
					residential area zoned for single-family housing is again
					shown in three colors indicating low (pink), moderate
					(orange), and high (red) percentages. The municipalities
					shown are those <em>explicitly</em>
					mentioned as part of the "Executive Belt" of estates by Amy
					Dain in her <em>Exclusionary by Design</em> report. I was
					surpised to see that four of these municipalities have zero
					single-family zoning, so I undertook a brief verification
					search. I found that the Wayland data is incorrect, and they
					are almost completely zoned for single-family housing, as
					shown in this <a
					href="https://www.wayland.ma.us/sites/g/files/vyhlif9231/f/uploads/zoning_color_5.pdf">
					district map</a>. This result brings into question the
					validity of the Warren Group dataset. Future work should be
					done to validate the single-family housing percentages,
					particularly for the "Executive Belt" municipalities shown
					here. Unfortunately, the unreliability of this data makes it
					difficult to address my first analysis question with
					confidence. In the following charts, I will therefore focus
					on my second analysis question.

				<img src="../images/200k-percentage_map.png" alt="percentage of households with $200k+ income" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
				Because the executive belt aimed to maintain affluent
				communities, I was curious what fraction of the households in
				each of these municipalities earned more than $200,000 per year.
				This metric is shown by the green color bar in the figure above,
				where darker green depicts larger fractions of the population
				making high salaries. Comparing to the previous figures, I find
				that the municipalities with the highest fractions of
				high-income households align with those appearing as the
				"Executive Belt". This aligns with the intentions of these
				communities and confirms the exclusionary class zoning. Notably,
				Wayland appears in line with the other executive belt
				municipalities, which further indicates that single-family
				percentage data point may be erroneous.

				<figcaption>
				While Amy Dain shows in her report that class exclusionary
				zoning has often been explicitly mentioned in policy growth
				statements, racial exclusionary zoning is much insidious. The
				practice is illegal, but that doesn't stop municipalities from
				employing subtle tactics such as "downzoning" to exclude. This
				map shows the fraction of population that is non-hispanic and
				white. The municipality with the largest fraction is Manchester
				(annotated on the map), with over 96% of the population
				identifying as white. As we showed previously, this municipality
				is also among those employing high (red) single-family zoning. 
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/pop-black_map.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that is
					non-hispanic and black. The municipality with the largest
					fraction is Randolph (annotated on the map), with over 35%
					of the population identifying as black. This municipality is
					also among those employing high (red) single-family zoning,
					which seems inconsistent with the message from Amy Dain's
					report; I am surprised she did not mention the black
					community living in this municipality with strict
					single-family zoning. Regardless, this map otherwise shows
					the segregation that persists today. With a few exceptions,
					there are few black families living in the communities
					surrounding Boston.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/pop-latino_map.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that is
					hispanic/latino. The municipality with the largest fraction
					is Chelsea (annoated on the map), with over 60% of the
					population identifying as Hispanic or Latino. This
					municipality has zero single-family housing zoning. Similar
					to the observed trend with black communities, there is clear
					segregation of communities, with few hispanic households in
					the "executive belt". In many of these communities, less
					than 2% of households are hispanic/latino.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/pop-asian_map.png" alt="" width="100%"
				height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that is
					non-hispanic asian. The municipality with the largest
					fraction is Malden (annoated on the map), with over 20% of
					the population identifying as asian. This municipality has
					zero single-family housing zoning. Unlike black or latino
					populations, we see a far more even spread of asian
					households throughout the municipalities. Amy Dain does not
					cover this phenomenon in her report, and I do not want to
					speculate, but this difference between asian and
					black/hispanic outcomes would be an interesting topic for
					future work.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/pop-otherRace_map.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that identify with
					multiple or other races/ethicities, including American
					Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, and others. These
					populations were considered as a group because they
					represent less than 2% of the population in most
					municipalities and at most 7% in one municipality (Everett).
					Like asian populations and unlike black or latino
					populations, we see a far more even spread of households
					throughout the municipalities. As mentioned previously, I do
					not want to speculate, but this would be an interesting
					topic for future work.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/pop-SF_bubble.png" alt="" width="100%"
				height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
				Taking a step back from racial and economic demographics, I
				wanted to see if any effects were related to population. In this
				bubble chart, I show the population of each municipality using
				the size of each circle. The coloring scheme is the same as the
				previous single-family housing percentage maps: low (pink),
				moderate (orange), and high (red). The most obvious feature in
				this chart is that the largest circles (Boston, Cambridge,
				Somerville, Malden, Everett, etc.) have low single-family zoning
				percentages. This result makes sense, because more urban areas
				(with high populations) generally have higher population
				densities via apartment buildings and multi-family homes, often
				enabled by robust public transit systems. Curiously, not all of
				the small circles are red though. While many of the smaller
				circles employ some amount of single-family zoning, there are
				several small pink circles (one of which, Carlisle, being
				explicitly in the "executive belt"). As mentioned previously,
				this result could be do to Carlisle's zoning percentages being
				misrepresented.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/popChildFraction-SF_bubble.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
				Amy Dain discussed municipalities trying to avoid fiscal
				penalties, such as the cost of putting more children through
				school. As such, I wanted to see if there was an observable
				impact of larger child populations on single-family zoning (or
				vice versa). In this chart, I am showing the fraction of the
				population that is under the age of 18 in the size of the
				circles, with larger circles depicting municipalities with a
				higher fraction of the population being children. The coloring
				scheme is the same as the previous single-family housing
				percentage maps: low (pink), moderate (orange), and high (red).
				Ultimately, I see very little variation between municipalities;
				many of these regions have similar fractions of the population
				under the age of 18, with a few exceptions: Milton (the small
				circle next to Salem), Wellesley (the small circle above
				Westwood), Cambridge, and Essex. Some of these exceptions are
				the location of sizable universities, which could explain some
				of this trend.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/mbta_map.png" alt="map of municipalities
				served by the MBTA" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
				Municipalities served by the MBTA are shown in blue, while those
				without connection are shown in green. Since the definition of
				"served by the MBTA" was broad, there is little granularity that
				would allow me to assess the data in terms of connectivity. For
				example, some municipalities were counted as "served" because a
				neighboring municipality had a T-stop. A dataset that
				distinguishs between these municipality would be more useful in
				assessing the interactions of housing zoning and connectivity.
				Important context is that this definition of "served by the
				MBTA" is being used to drive affordable multi-family housing
				development. From the map, we can see that almost all
				municipalities will be required to expand multi-family housing
				options under this <a
				href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities">
				state law</a>.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>There is a long history of excusionary zoning in the Greater Boston
			area. This history includes four major areas, according to Amy
			Dain's <em>Exclusionary by Design</em>: original adoption (1920's
			and 1930's), postwar era (up to approximately 1968), The Big
			Downzone (1968-1975), and the current era (1975 - present). The most
			relevant areas for my analysis are as follows: i) the post war era,
			where municipalities tightened zoning requirements and some affluent
			communities formed an "estate belt" by "[zoning] for very large
			minimum lot sizes for single-family homes and mostly banned
			multifamily housing" and ii) The Big Downzone, where communities
			responded to desegregation and activist pushes to reform zoning by
			"shifting to official policies of 'no growth' or 'low growth'". </p>

			<p>The effects of these zoning policies are still evident today. I
			showed that strict zoning laws still exist in a ring surounding
			Boston, although some municipalities (particularly those near
			Downtown Boston) have zero single-family zoning. Further,
			racial/ethnic segregation persists today, where many municipalities,
			and particularly those with strict single-family zoning, are
			predominantly white and disproportionately have higher household
			incomes. This segregation is most pronounced for black and
			hispanic/latino communities; these populations are concentrated in a
			few municipalities. Asian populations, however, are more evenly
			distributed throughout the Greater Boston area; the different
			outcomes for asian and black/hispanic populations would be an
			interesting topic for future work.</p>
