			<h2>Subtheme: Visualizing Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How has the “executive belt” surrounding Boston changed? Do
				these areas still have extensive single-family zoning? </li>
				<li>Are there certain municipalities that have higher fractions
				of non-white residents? Do municipalities with higher fractions
				have less single-family zoning? Are there observable differences
				in income, household size, and number of children?</li>
				<li>Which municipalities that sought “no growth” achieved it?
				How much did they grow/evolve since the 1970's?</li>
				<li>How are rail network access and municipal housing
				composition related? </li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			The dataset provided by The Warren Group consists of information on
			residential zoning, demographics, and household income and
			composition for municipalities served by the Boston Metropolitian
			Area Planning Council. Prior to engaging with this data, I read
			<em>Exclusionary by Design</em> by Amy Dain. This report details the
			history of exclusionary zoning practices in Greater Boston,
			including fiscal, class, and racist zoning, since the 1920's. My
			analysis will focus on similar themes.
			
			Before approaching my overall analysis questions, I began with a
			brief review of data quality. The first thing I discovered was that
			some municipalities are duplicated in the dataset. For such
			municipalities, the data on areas zoned for single-family housing is
			recorded separately and notated by a <label for="only_single_housing"></label>
			flag. 

			After filtering out the separate single-family data, I began by
			looking at the percentage of residential land zoned for
			single-family housing in each municipality, as shown in Figure 1. My
			first takeaway is that many municipalities still employ extensive
			single-family zoning — 48 municipalities zone the majority of
			residential land for single-families, marked by those above the
			dashed line. Next, I noticed the group of municipalities with zero
			single-family zoning.

				Metropolitian Area municipality listed on the horizontal axis.
				The dashed line indicates 50% single-family zoning, highlighting
				the 48 municipalities that zone the majority of their
				residential land for single-family housing.

			I plotted the same data on a map, as shown in Figure 2, to look for
			any spatial trends. I plotted with three color bins to highlight
			regions with low, moderate, and high percentages of single-family
			zoning. The first feature I notice is the ring of red, which in 1960
			the Boston Globe dubbed as the "Executive Belt". This ring of
			affluent communities maintained their status through the use of
			exclusionary zoning techniques. In following figures, we will
			further address the first two analysis questions with these in mind.

				The percentage of residential area zoned for single-family
				housing is shown in three colors indicating low (pink), moderate
				(orange), and high (red) percentages. Assessing this data in a
				map highlights the "Executive Belt", where municipalities
				extensively zoned for estates. These municipalities used
				exclusionary zoning techniques to encourage and maintain
				affluent and predominantly white communities.

			Before we assess the demographics of each municipality, I wanted to
			focus on the estates explicitly mentioned as part of the "Executive
			Belt" in Amy Dain's report. Accordingly, I filtered the results from
			the previous map to show only these municipalities in Figure 3. I
			was surprised to see that multiple municipalities were recorded as
			having zero single-family zoning: Wayland, Carlisle, Westwood, and
			Hamilton. The rest of the executive municipalities maintained very
			high percentages of single-family zoning. To verify this result, I
			looked into the zoning of Wayland specifically and found a <a href="https://www.wayland.ma.us/sites/g/files/vyhlif9231/f/uploads/zoning_color_5.pdf"> district map</a>
			showing they <em>are almost entirely zoned for single-family
			housing</em> (Wayland Inc., 2019). This result is in conflict with
			the dataset provided my The Warren Group, which brings into question
			the validity of the data in this report. Future work should be done
			to validate the single-family housing percentages, particularly for
			the "Executive Belt" municipalities shown here.

					The percentage of residential area zoned for single-family
					housing is shown in three colors indicating low (pink),
					moderate (orange), and high (red) percentages. The
					municipalities shown in this map are those explicitly
					mentioned as part of the "Executive Belt" of estates by Amy
					Dain in her <em>Exclusionary by Design</em> report. I was
					surpised to see that four of these municipalities have zero
					single-family zoning, so I undertook a brief verification
					search. I found that the Wayland data is incorrect, and they
					are almost completely zoned for single-family housing.
