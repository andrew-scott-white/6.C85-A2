			<h2>Subtheme: Visualizing Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How has the “executive belt” surrounding Boston changed? Do
				these areas still have extensive single-family zoning? </li>
				<li>Are there certain municipalities that have higher fractions
				of non-white residents? Do municipalities with higher fractions
				have less single-family zoning?</li> 
				<li>Are there observable differences between municipalities in
				terms of income, household size, and number of children?</li>
				<li>How are rail network access and municipal housing
				composition related? </li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			The dataset provided by The Warren Group consists of information on
			residential zoning, demographics, and household income and
			composition for municipalities served by the Boston Metropolitian
			Area Planning Council. Prior to engaging with this data, I read
			<em>Exclusionary by Design</em> by Amy Dain. This report details the
			history of exclusionary zoning practices in Greater Boston,
			including fiscal, class, and racist zoning, since the 1920's. My
			analysis will focus on similar themes.
			
			Before approaching my overall analysis questions, I began with a
			brief review of data quality. The first thing I discovered was that
			some municipalities are duplicated in the dataset. For such
			municipalities, the data on areas zoned for single-family housing is
			recorded separately and notated by a <label
			for="only_single_housing"></label>
			flag. These single-family-only datasets were filtered out; the
			analysis to follow focuses on whole municipalities.

				<figcaption>
				The percentage of residential area zoned for single-family
				housing is shown on the vertical axis for each Boston
				Metropolitian Area municipality listed on the horizontal axis.
				The dashed line indicates 50% single-family zoning, highlighting
				the 48 municipalities that zone the majority of their
				residential land for single-family housing. Of note, there are
				many municipalities that have zero single-family zoning as well.
				I was surprised to see some "executive belt" municipalities
				among them, which motivated Figure 3. It is also surprising that
				some municipalities are zoned for 100% single-family housing. Is
				there really not one apartment building in these regions?

				The percentage of residential area zoned for single-family
				housing is shown in three colors indicating low (pink),
				moderate (orange), and high (red) percentages. Assessing this
				data in a map highlights spatial effects including the
				"Executive Belt", dubbed by the Boston Globe in 1960, where
				municipalities extensively zoned for single-family estates.
				These municipalities used exclusionary zoning techniques to
				encourage and maintain affluent and predominantly white
				communities.

				<figcaption>
					To address my first analysis question, the percentage of
					residential area zoned for single-family housing is again
					shown in three colors indicating low (pink), moderate
					(orange), and high (red) percentages. The municipalities
					shown are those <em>explicitly</em>
					mentioned as part of the "Executive Belt" of estates by Amy
					Dain in her <em>Exclusionary by Design</em> report. I was
					surpised to see that four of these municipalities have zero
					single-family zoning, so I undertook a brief verification
					search. I found that the Wayland data is incorrect, and they
					are almost completely zoned for single-family housing, as
					shown in this <a
					href="https://www.wayland.ma.us/sites/g/files/vyhlif9231/f/uploads/zoning_color_5.pdf">
					district map</a>. This result brings into question the
					validity of the Warren Group dataset. Future work should be
					done to validate the single-family housing percentages,
					particularly for the "Executive Belt" municipalities shown
					here.

				<img src="../images/200k-percentage_map.png" alt="percentage of households with $200k+ income" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
				Because the executive belt aimed to maintain affluent
				communities, I was curious what fraction of the households in
				each of these municipalities earned more than $200,000 per year.
				This metric is shown by the green color bar in the figure above,
				where darker green depicts larger fractions of the population
				making high salaries. Comparing to the previous figures, I find
				that the municipalities with the highest fractions of
				high-income households align with those appearing as the
				"Executive Belt". This aligns with the intentions of these
				communities and confirms the exclusionary class zoning. Notably,
				Wayland appears in line with the other executive belt
				municipalities, which further indicates that single-family
				percentage data point may be erroneous.

				<figcaption>
				While Amy Dain shows in her report that class exclusionary
				zoning has often been explicitly mentioned in policy growth
				statements, racial exclusionary zoning is much insidious. The
				practice is illegal, but that doesn't stop municipalities from
				employing subtle tactics such as "downzoning" to exclude. This
				map shows the fraction of population that is non-hispanic and
				white. The municipality with the largest fraction is Manchester
				(annotated on the map), with over 96% of the population
				identifying as white. As we showed previously, this municipality
				is also among those employing high (red) single-family zoning.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/pop-black_map.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that is
					non-hispanic and black. The municipality with the largest
					fraction is Randolph (annotated on the map), with over 35%
					of the population identifying as black. This municipality is
					also among those employing high (red) single-family zoning,
					which seems inconsistent with the message from Amy Dain's
					report; I am surprised she did not mention the black
					community living in this municipality with strict
					single-family zoning. Regardless, this map otherwise shows
					the segregation that persists today. With a few exceptions,
					there are few black families living in the communities
					surrounding Boston.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/pop-latino_map.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that is
					hispanic/latino. The municipality with the largest fraction
					is Chelsea (annoated on the map), with over 60% of the
					population identifying as Hispanic or Latino. This
					municipality has zero single-family housing zoning. Similar
					to the observed trend with black communities, there is clear
					segregation of communities, with few hispanic households in
					the "executive belt". In many of these communities, less
					than 2% of households are hispanic/latino.

				<img src="../images/pop-asian_map.png" alt="" width="100%"
				height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that is
					non-hispanic asian. The municipality with the largest
					fraction is Malden (annoated on the map), with over 20% of
					the population identifying as asian. This municipality has
					zero single-family housing zoning. Unlike black or latino
					populations, we see a far more even spread of asian
					households throughout the municipalities. Amy Dain does not
					cover this phenomenon in her report, and I do not want to
					speculate, but this difference between asian and
					black/hispanic outcomes would be an interesting topic for
					future work.

				<img src="../images/pop-otherRace_map.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					This map shows the fraction of population that identify with
					multiple or other races/ethicities, including American
					Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, and others. These
					populations were considered as a group because they
					represent less than 2% of the population in most
					municipalities and at most 7% in one municipality (Everett).
					Like asian populations and unlike black or latino
					populations, we see a far more even spread of households
					throughout the municipalities. As mentioned previously, I do
					not want to speculate, but this would be an interesting
					topic for future work.

				<figcaption>
				Municipalities served by the MBTA are shown in blue, while those
				without connection are shown in green. Since the definition of
				"served by the MBTA" was broad, there is little granularity that
				would allow me to assess the data in terms of connectivity.
				Important context is that this definition of "served by the
				MBTA" is being used to drive affordable multi-family housing
				development. From the map, we can see that almost all
				municipalities will be required to expand multi-family housing
				options under this <a
				href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities">
				state law</a>.
