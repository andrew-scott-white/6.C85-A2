    <h2>Proposition: a few large, industrialized nations are disproportionately contributing to the climate crisis through their emission of carbon dioxide. More generally, nations in the global north (positive latitudes, north of the equator) are responsible for over 90% of carbon dioxide emissions.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="../images/A4_for.png" alt="A treemap showing the percentage contribution of each nation to direct anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (excludes effects of land use change)." width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					Annual percentages of net carbon dioxide emissions from each
					nation are shown in the different sized boxes. The color
					denotes global north (red) and south (blue), differentiated
					by positive and negative average latitudes. Effects from
					land use change and non-CO2 emissions (i.e. carbon dioxide
					equivalent) are not shown in this chart.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The decision to show national emissions, as opposed to per
				capita, highlights the impact that industrialized nations have.
				Often, people attempt to deflect the blame onto individuals
				despite companies being largely responsible for this pollution.
				This chart answers that by showing the disproportionate impact
				that a few nations have. Seeing that China and the United States
				occupy nearly half the figure is intended to evoke an emotional,
				perhaps embarassed, but I would not call it deceptive [1]. </li>
				<li>I also chose to show the global north and south, defined by
				positive and negative lines of latitude. The intent is to show
				that the global south is disproportionately harmed relative to
				their contributions. The choice of color, red for the one I am
				calling out and blue for the one harmed, it certainly affective.
				I wouldn't say this is deceptive, but I will rank it in that
				direction [-0.5]. </li>
				<li>The annotation is meant to respond to the unintended
				conclusion of "wow, China is the problem", which is partially
				fueled by my decision to show national magnitudes not per
				capita. China has over four times the population of the United
				States but only three times as many carbon emissions. As such, I
				placed the caption such that it draws the eyes towards the
				United States, where I explain that multiple other nations also
				contribute greatly to the problem. The viewer might next notice
				the caption in the largest blue square, which emphasizes that
				the global south is disproportionately harmed relative to their
				contribution. I would call these decisions earnest [1.5]. </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="../images/A4_for.png" alt="A treemap showing the per capita contributiosn of each nation's citizens to net carbon dioxide emissions including the effects of land use change." width="100%" height="auto" />
				<figcaption>
					Annual per capita emissions (tons/yr per person) of net
					carbon dioxide from each nation's citizens are shown in the
					different sized boxes. The color denotes global north (red)
					and south (blue), differentiated by positive and negative
					average latitudes. Effects from non-CO2 emissions (i.e.
					carbon dioxide equivalent) are not shown in this chart.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>By considering emissions per capita, I am amplifying the
				contributions of nations with small populations. This effect is
				further exacerbated by the inclusion of land use changes.
				Forestation can offset substantial carbon dioxide emissions, so
				small island nations or regions with little forest coverage look
				much worse than a similar nation with forests. This decision
				makes the split between north and south a bit more even, and it
				downplays the effects of the populous, industrialized nations
				[-1]. </li>
				<li>I placed a caption in bolded red text (unfairly) blaming the
				people of the Solomon Islands for causing the climate crisis.
				This choice leans into the viewers tendenacy to focus on the
				largest square, which I leverage to make this nation a scapegoat
				[-2].</li>
				<li>The source caption in the bottom left is an attempt to lend
				credibility to my conclusions. I note the source as an
				international (seemingly unbiased) fund that is focused on
				climate change! Surely they know what they are talking about.
				This choice is incredibly deceptive because it seems like my
				figure comes from them when, in reality, they only provided the
				dataset. They do not necessarily agree with my conclusions here
				[-2].</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Overall, this exercise was useful and enjoyable! It was difficult
      trying to figure out how to express the same dataset in polar opposite
      directions. My approach was to figure out how I felt about the data and
      drawing some conclusions. Then, I thought about how I might argue against
      myself. My intention with these charts is to get at the arguments about
      who is responsible for emissions. In my first chart, I argue that large,
      industrial nations are largely responsible. In the latter, I employ
      corporate rhetorical tactics to put the blame on the individual and take
      it even further by faulting a small island nation that i) ultimately
      contributes very little to the problem and ii) is most threatened by
      climate change due to rising sea levels. </p> 
	
	  <p> This project has further solidified by view that data can be made to
	  say anything. Every choice has some intention behind it, even when not
	  being intentionally deceptive. Further, some might consider decisions I
	  made to be deceptive if they have a different background or perspective.
	  Others might draw conclusions that I did not intend, and they will see my
	  work as supporting a different narrative. For example, one might conclude
	  that China is the problem and no one else should bother reducing emissions
	  until they do. I try to "head off" this argument through the use and
	  positioning of captions. I attempt to draw the viewers attention to guide
	  them to a more nuanced perspective: large nations like China and the
	  United States are the problem. No one nation is responsible for the
	  problem, but some nations contribute more than others.</p>
