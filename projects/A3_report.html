			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="../images/A3_lineChart.jpg" alt="Sketch of line charts showing percentage of population in each 5-year age group over 60 years old." width = "100%" height = "auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					•	Dashed line indicates federal age of retirement in 2000 (65) for social security to give the viewer a point of reference. Some folks retire early (in the 60-65 bracket), so this line may be misleading.
					•	This plot could be condensed with all lines stacked vertically, rather than repeating the x-axis; this change would improve clarity and conserve space.
					•	I thought to include a different dashed age line for 1900, but retirement was not legally codified until decades later. Perhaps this point of reference is therefore not useful?
					•	An annotation in the 2000 chart describing the Social Security age of retirement might be better than a dashed line.
					•	Explore bubble in the next plot so that magnitude of population can be visualized alongside the corresponding fractions

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/A3_pies.jpg" alt="Sketch of pie charts showing percentage of population in each 5-year age group over 60 years old." width = "100%" height = "auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					•	I show magnitude of population in the size of each circle, with each slide showing difference age groups. The size is useful in showing that more people in 2000 are over 60 than 1900, but it doesn’t meaningfully compare this number to total population (despite the annotation).
					•	Showing the split between women/men is distracting and not useful for answering my question
					•	Pie chart with only a subset of age groups is misleading. Maybe I can show total population with size, fraction of population 60+ with angle of slice (focusing on that and filtering out ages less than 60), and breaking into sub-slices for each age group; aggregate male and female data.

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/A3_slices.jpg" alt="Sketch of pie chart slice showing percentage of population in each 5-year age group over 60 years old." width = "100%" height = "auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					•	The radius of the circle clearly shows the large increase in population while displaying the corresponding fraction of folks over 60+.
					•	Annotating the true populations will contextualize the change in size
					•	Age groups should be shown with a monocolored gradient because we aren’t considering any other demographic data (sex, race, etc.) but age.
					•	It might be difficult to distinguish between similar pie slice fractions (e.g. 1/6 vs 1/5), so annotations may be helpful depending on the results.
					•	“American Seniors”, as used in the title, does not feel like the appropriate umbrella term for folks over 60 years old; maybe just use a number (60+) to describe the group I referring to?
