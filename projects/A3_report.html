			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="../images/A3_lineChart.jpg" alt="Sketch of line charts showing percentage of population in each 5-year age group over 60 years old." width = "100%" height = "auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					Sketch of a line plot depicting percentage of U.S. population on the y-axis that is within each 5-year age group, shown on the x-axis. This plot depicts results using census data from the year 1900 (left) and 2000 (right).
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Dashed line indicates federal age of retirement in 2000 (65) for social security to give the viewer a point of reference. Some folks retire early (in the 60-65 bracket), so this line may be misleading.</li>
				<li>This plot could be condensed with all lines stacked vertically, rather than repeating the x-axis; this change would improve clarity and conserve space.</li>
				<li>I thought to include a different dashed age line for 1900, but retirement was not legally codified until decades later. Perhaps this point of reference is therefore not useful?</li>
				<li>An annotation in the 2000 chart describing the Social Security age of retirement might be better than a dashed line.</li>
				<li>Explore bubble in the next plot so that magnitude of population can be visualized alongside the corresponding fractions</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/A3_pies.jpg" alt="Sketch of pie charts showing percentage of population in each 5-year age group over 60 years old." width = "100%" height = "auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					Sketch of pie charts depicting the fraction of the U.S. population over the age of sixty that belongs to each 5-year age group. The data is split for women and men based on census data from the year 1900 (left) and 2000 (right).
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I show magnitude of population in the size of each circle, with each slide showing difference age groups. The size is useful in showing that more people in 2000 are over 60 than 1900, but it doesn’t meaningfully compare this number to total population (despite the annotation).</li>
				<li>Showing the split between women/men is distracting and not useful for answering my question</li>
				<li>Pie chart with only a subset of age groups is misleading. Maybe I can show total population with size, fraction of population 60+ with angle of slice (focusing on that and filtering out ages under 60), and breaking into sub-slices for each age group; aggregate male and female data.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/A3_slices.jpg" alt="Sketch of pie chart slice showing percentage of population in each 5-year age group over 60 years old." width = "100%" height = "auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					Sketch of pie chart slices depicting the fraction of the U.S. population over the age of sixty that belongs to each 5-year age group. The chart depicts census data from the year 1900 (left) and 2000 (right).
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The radius of the circle clearly shows the large increase in population while displaying the corresponding fraction of folks over 60+.</li>
				<li>Annotating the true populations will contextualize the change in size</li>
				<li>Age groups should be shown with a monocolored gradient because we aren’t considering any other demographic data (sex, race, etc.) but age.</li>
				<li>It might be difficult to distinguish between similar pie slice fractions (e.g. 1/6 vs 1/5), so annotations may be helpful depending on the results.</li>
				<li>“American Seniors”, as used in the title, does not feel like the appropriate umbrella term for folks over 60 years old; maybe just use a number (60+) to describe the group I referring to?</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        My three sketches illustrate the increase in population over the age of
        retirement (as defined by the full retirement age for U.S. Social
        Security in 2000) between the years 1900 and 2000. The first sketch is a
        standard line plot showing the fraction of the population in each age
        group, split by sex. This chart uses white space to illustrate the
        change, but it does a poor job of contextualizing the scale of the
        populations in both centuries. The second sketch attempts to address
        this issue by showing magnitude of population in the size of pie charts,
        with the age group fractions over the age of 60 shown as slices. The
        main issues here are that i) women and men are needlessly displayed
        separately and ii) only showing slices of the population over 60 is
        misleading, as it seems there are no people under 60. The third sketch
        addresses these issues by aggregating men and women and showing these
        populations over 60 as a slice of a larger population pie chart. The
        other age groups are filtered out, but the viewer can still judge both
        the magnitude of the population (based on the radius of the circle) and
        the relevant fraction of seniors (based on the angle of the slice).
        Based on these attributes, I think the third sketch is the best of the
        three; however, I need to consider whether annotations and a different
        title would be helpful in articulating the answer to my question.
