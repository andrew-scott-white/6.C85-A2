			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<strong>Question: How many more people are reaching the age of retirement in 2000 than 1900?</strong>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Dashed line indicates federal age of retirement in 2000 (65) for social security to give the viewer a point of reference. Some folks retire early (in the 60-65 bracket), so this line may be misleading.</li>
				<li>This plot could be condensed with all lines stacked vertically, rather than repeating the x-axis; this change would improve clarity and conserve space.</li>
				<li>I thought to include a different dashed age line for 1900, but retirement was not legally codified until decades later. Perhaps this point of reference is therefore not useful?</li>
				<li>An annotation in the 2000 chart describing the Social Security age of retirement might be better than a dashed line.</li>
				<li>Explore bubble in the next plot so that magnitude of population can be visualized alongside the corresponding fractions</li>
			</ul>

				<figcaption>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I show magnitude of population in the size of each circle, with each slide showing difference age groups. The size is useful in showing that more people in 2000 are over 60 than 1900, but it doesn’t meaningfully compare this number to total population (despite the annotation).</li>
				<li>Showing the split between women/men is distracting and not useful for answering my question</li>
				<li>Pie chart with only a subset of age groups is misleading. Maybe I can show total population with size, fraction of population 60+ with angle of slice (focusing on that and filtering out ages under 60), and breaking into sub-slices for each age group; aggregate male and female data.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The radius of the circle clearly shows the large increase in population while displaying the corresponding fraction of folks over 60+.</li>
				<li>Annotating the true populations will contextualize the change in size</li>
				<li>Age groups should be shown with a monocolored gradient because we aren’t considering any other demographic data (sex, race, etc.) but age.</li>
				<li>It might be difficult to distinguish between similar pie slice fractions (e.g. 1/6 vs 1/5), so annotations may be helpful depending on the results.</li>
				<li>“American Seniors”, as used in the title, does not feel like the appropriate umbrella term for folks over 60 years old; maybe just use a number (60+) to describe the group I referring to?</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        My three sketches illustrate the increase in population over the age of
        retirement (as defined by the full retirement age for U.S. Social
        Security in 2000) between the years 1900 and 2000. The first sketch is a
        standard line plot showing the fraction of the population in each age
        group, split by sex. This chart uses white space to illustrate the
        change, but it does a poor job of contextualizing the scale of the
        populations in both centuries. The second sketch attempts to address
        this issue by showing magnitude of population in the size of pie charts,
        with the age group fractions over the age of 60 shown as slices. The
        main issues here are that i) women and men are needlessly displayed
        separately and ii) only showing slices of the population over 60 is
        misleading, as it seems there are no people under 60. The third sketch
        addresses these issues by aggregating men and women and showing these
        populations over 60 as a slice of a larger population pie chart. The
        other age groups are filtered out, but the viewer can still judge both
        the magnitude of the population (based on the radius of the circle) and
        the relevant fraction of seniors (based on the angle of the slice).
        Based on these attributes, I think the third sketch is the best of the
        three; however, I need to consider whether annotations and a different
        title would be helpful in articulating the answer to my question.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>
			<strong>Question: How many more American seniors are there in the year 2000 compared to 1900?</strong>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        Once I had decided on a pie chart concept similar to my third sketch, I
        had to make several design decisions. First, I had trouble filtering out
        the age groups under 60 years of age (the cutoff I use for defining
        'senior') to make the 'pie slice' style chart I sketched. When I
        filtered out an age group, it removed them from the pie altogether,
        rather than hiding that particular slice. My solution was to group all
        ages under 60 years and color it with a light grey. The age groups I
        cared about were shown in a single color so the viewer can clearly see
        how the fraction of seniors compares to that of non-seniors. I chose the
        color blue because it is a calm and relaxing color, which I asociated
        with retirement and rest. 

		I chose to plot the data for 1900 and 2000 using two pie charts of
		different size, where the larger population is depicted by a larger pie.
		The viewer can then see both the change in total population as well as
		the change in fraction of senior population. I originally only annotated
		the total population, as in my third sketch, but I had trouble
		connecting the scale of population with the size of each slice.
		Therefore, I annotated a few slices to give viewers a point of
		reference; specifically, I labelled the largest slice (under 60), the
		largest senior slice (60-64), and the smallest slice (90+). The chart
		was too busy if I annotated all of the slices, but the viewer can
		approximate the magnitude of other age groups by comparing to the
		annotated slices. My intent was to show the viewer that a larger part of
		the population today is senior (as shown by 2000 data). I chose to list
		the total population and not the total number of seniors (60+) to force
		the viewer to consider the population of seniors <em>relative</em> to
		the total population; if the total number was visible, they would focus
		on that magnitude rather than the fraction.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Sketching my ideas before working with the data in Tableau really helped
        me figure out which features in the data I wanted to focus on and what
        visualization tools I could use to do that. My default idea was to use a
        line chart, but that focused too much on each of the age groups. Drawing
        out these ideas also helped me realize what features were not important,
        such as the data on men and women. I discarded the annotations of each
        age group in favor of a legend because the slices were thinner than I
        anticipated. A drawback to sketching is that I came up with something
        that was difficult or impossible to produce with the software available.
        The broader learning is that the unconstrained ideation via sketching
        might lead me to evaluate whether the tool I planned on using is even
        the best for that application.
